Portfolio of Parvathy Jayakrishnan
This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my journey as a B.Tech CSE student. The website highlights my learning progress, skills, and contact information. I have included a blog section where I document my experience of building this website.
The site is built using HTML and CSS only, ensuring a clean, responsive, and accessible design. It features:
(i) A structured navigation bar for easy browsing.
(ii) A home section introducing myself.
(iii) An about section detailing my background and interests.
(iv) A project section showcasing my completed projects.
(v) A blog section sharing my learning experiences.
(vi) A contact section with links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.

This portfolio will continue to evolve as I work on new projects and improve my skills.
