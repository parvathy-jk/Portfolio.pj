            <h3>Structuring the Website with HTML</h3>
            <p>Creating my portfolio website was an exciting journey that helped me apply my HTML and CSS knowledge. I divided the site into multiple sections, such as Home, About, Blog, and Contact, ensuring a clear structure using semantic elements like 'header' and 'section'.</p>

            <h3>Styling the Website with CSS</h3>
            <p>To make my website visually appealing, I focused on CSS styling. I implemented a consistent color scheme, used Flexbox for layout, and added hover effects to enhance interactivity. CSS transitions made elements appear smoothly, creating a more polished look.</p>

            <h3>Adding Personal Touches</h3>
            <p>Since I don't have projects to showcase yet, I decided to make my portfolio engaging by writing this blog, adding an image of myself, and including a disclaimer about my learning progress. This keeps the site meaningful while I work on future projects.</p>
